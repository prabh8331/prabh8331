<h3 align="left">Professionally, I am a data engineer, continuously learning and exploring different areas in data engineering to become better at my craft. Personally, I enjoy working on my home server, exploring open-source projects as alternatives to proprietary websites and software to protect my data from big companies and avoid paying for services that can be achieved with some effort. I am also transitioning completely from Windows to Linux on my desktop, exploring various Linux options to ensure I don't need to return to Windows for personal use. This profile focuses on these pursuits and my personal learning."</h3>
